# `baby-pool` - A tiny thread pool
No diving allowed!

This is a quick and dirty thread pool I wrote up for non-async FIFO work queue operations because
`rayon` and `tokio`, which are both fantastic packages, didn't quite do what I wanted.

For more info on this package, check out [the docs](https://docs.rs/baby-pool).
